PHSL: Xuanji Strategic Audit Terminal 🛡️

Python History Strategy Lab (PHSL) presents the Xuanji Strategic Audit Terminal, an advanced, AI-driven wargaming and strategic simulation system.

Xuanji performs rigorous "Red Team" audits on strategic visions by mapping modern operational plans to historical prototypes. By integrating systems thinking, the principles of Sun Tzu (孙子兵法), and the shifting dynamics of the I Ching (易经) hexagrams, the system quantifies the physical viability of a strategy against real-world environmental noise, friction, and resistance.

📐 The Core Strategic Axiom

At the heart of the Xuanji engine is the structural conservation of historical and realistic isomorphism. Strategic effectiveness is calculated using the following core formula:

$$E = \frac{P \cdot (ssc\_d \cdot L)}{(I \cdot (1 + vol)) + P}$$

Dimensional Variables:

$E$ (Strategic Effectiveness): The actualized impact of the strategy.  
$P$ (Resource Pressure): The resources and effort applied.  
$ssc\_d$ (SSC Density / Logical Density): The binding strength between the strategic vision and physical assets (prior probability of success).  
$L$ (Leverage): The strategic multiplier (e.g., technological generation gaps).  
$I$ (Inertia): The inherent resistance or friction of the target environment.  
$vol$ (Volatility): Geopolitical or market fluctuations.

✨ Key Features

Strategic Oracle (AI Intelligence): Powered by Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model, the Oracle module dynamically searches for historical prototypes, estimates Bayesian parameters, and outputs comprehensive JSON-formatted intelligence reports.

Bayesian Cognitive Engine: Refines the probability of success using Bayesian noise filtration (FRE Validation) and Monte Carlo simulations to find the "Truth Distribution."

Physics-Based Stress Testing:  
* ERT (Environmental Resilience Test): Calculates system stability and identifies the critical Collapse Line (Break Point / BP).  
* SIP (Strategic Ignition Point): Models efficiency against environmental resistance to find the exact Activation Pressure (AP) needed for a strategy to take effect across different leverage tiers (L1-L3 vs. L-0 Baseline).

Interactive UI & Visualizations: A sleek Streamlit dashboard (app.py) combined with matplotlib logic (visualizer.py) to render structural resilience audits and truth curves.

🚀 Installation & Setup1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:(Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed)2. Install required dependencies:Bashpip install streamlit google-genai matplotlib pandas numpy
3. Configure Network/Proxy (If applicable):By default, oracle.py is configured with local proxies (http://127.0.0.1:7890). If you are running this in an environment without proxy requirements, you may need to comment out lines 10-11 in oracle.py.💻 UsageRun the Streamlit application from your terminal:Bashstreamlit run app.py
Operating the Terminal:Open the local web address provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).In the sidebar console, enter your Google Gemini API Key.Input your Strategic Vision Description (e.g., "The impact of the Belt and Road Initiative on restructuring global supply chains...").Click "⚡ 启动全领域审计" (Initiate All-Domain Audit).Review the generated intelligence reports, historical isomorphism mappings, and physics-based stress test charts.🛠️ System Components BreakdownThe Oracle (oracle.py): Acts as the Chief Auditing Officer. It enforces logical dimensionality reduction, applies real-time intelligence gathering, and matches inputs with evolutionary or military history.The Engine (engine.py): Executes the mathematical heavy lifting. It applies noise filters to leverage factors, ensuring that technological or structural advantages decay appropriately in high-noise environments.The Visualizer (visualizer.py): Generates high-fidelity, cyberpunk-styled (dark theme) charts to visualize the Monte Carlo truth curves and strategic hedge auditing.
